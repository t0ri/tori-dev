`tori.dev` is my personal website which you can view [here](https://tori.dev).

This MVP was created in only **4 days**: 1 to design the website, and 3 to code and ship.

Written in React and Sass, and served via my [authenticated DjangoÂ API](https://t0ri-make-school-coursework.github.io/create-portfolio-backend/#/).

Code quality was enforcned using the ESLint Airbnb style guide!
